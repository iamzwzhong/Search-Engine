# Search-Engine
A search engine designed to search through the given web pages using queries

This project effectively gave me a basic breakdown about how a search engine works
on the web. It uses many different types of heuristics to ensure that the engine understands
exactly what the user wants. This allows them to provide user's with the best experience. 

A GUI was self designed to provide the front of the search engine.
The project itself was not used to crawl through the web. It was used to crawl through a portion of 
ics.uci.edu's domain. Results were parsed and traps were filtered out to increase speed and to prevent 
the search engine from being stuck in an infinite loop.
